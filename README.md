# qgis-multiple-layers-edit
This plugin does the following on all selected layers and groups :

First button turns on edit mode.
Second button saves (commit changes).
Third button undo's.
Fourth button gets the first valid layer filter, opens the Query builder and applies filter on all selected layers and groups.
The fifth button clears all selected layers filters.

It makes easier to work on large projects with a lot of layers and groups.
